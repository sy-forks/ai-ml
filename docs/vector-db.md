### Vector Search

A vector index is a condensed form of raw vectors that allow efficient, rapid searches.

Indices come in many forms and are created by different algorithmic approaches.

The four core implementation methodologies of ANNS-based indices —
- **Flat**: 
- **Tree-based**: 
- **Graph-based**: Hierarchical Navigable Small Words (HNSW).
- **Hash-based**:
- **Quantization-based**: Product Quantization

index space is split into hierarchical layers, thus the “H” in HNSW
